# The Cancel Button
This is a practice webpage for using basic PHP and a MySQL database
it simply takes user input and inserts it into the database
you must be running MySQL for it to work locally i use XAMPP for local apache and MySQL

Here is a link to the live version on my schools web server
i was playing around with widgets on the live version
also the live version shows all of the user input my friends have entered
